    <h2>Hello! welcome to the Projects Page!</h2>
    <h3>project 1 - Designing a Functional Computer Network</h3>
    <p>In my Advanced Networking 2 class, I created a functional computer network with various devices such as routers, switches, pc's, etc. I created an addressing table so that I could assign an address to each device. I also configured various routing protocols on the routers including ospf, eigrp, bgp. I ensured it was fully functional through pinging from each device ensuring connectivity.</p>
    <h3>project 2 - Creating VMs on AWS</h3>
    <p>In my Intro to Cloud Computing class, I created a script that helps us create/launch additional vm’s from our cli (ubuntu terminal). After the initial set up was conducted, using a script that helps us retrieve ami id (the number needed to run aws instances from the newest version of ubuntu) and the previously set up key name and security group.</p>
    <h3>project 3 - Designing Networking Documentation</h3>
    <p>In my Advanced Networking 3 class, we had to create a documentation of a network based on various show commands. We weren't allowed to look at the physical equipment and had to create topology diagrams of the equipment/devices. </p>
    <h3>project 4 - Evaluating the Accuracy of AI</h3>
    <p>In my Economics and Politics of the Environment class, we had to feed an article to an AI chat box, then ask it to answer various questions on the article. We then had to assess ourselves how accurately it was able to answer the prompts given. </p>
