I made a website showcasing who I am.
here is a link to the website: https://ayeshahaider04.github.io/assignment1/
here is a link to my repo for this assignment: https://github.com/ayeshahaider04/assignment1

info about the pages: 
- home page was made using index.html, it provides navigation to the other pages
- about page was made on about.html and it includes a description and a photo
- projects page was made on project.html listed 4 projects that i worked on this year under the specified headings
- contact page was made under contact.html it had several text input boxes to enter name email and comments

viewport info:
- mobile was chosen to be 480px = the size of most phones 
- tablet was chosen to be larger than 481px smaller than 960px = the size of most tablets
- full(desktop) was chosen to be 960px = the size of most desktops 
this was so that the website could fit into the screens of various sizes through the code adjusting the way it looks in order to fit everything

gradient info:
the body of each had the same linear gradient colour scheme, i chose the same colour scheme from lecture 1

extra notes:
this website was made through the use of only css3 and html 5
all my code was found through the lectures besides how to add a photo, i figured out how to do that from this youtube video https://youtu.be/_w6N_nplmAw
